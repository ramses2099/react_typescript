React TypeScript Tutorial

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Why TypeScript + React

- With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, than
  heading to the browser and firugin out at runtime.

- Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete

- Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code base much easier.

- TypeScript is just frustrating mos of the time

- I have to write a lot more code than I normally do and the compiler keeps complaining. I simply don't know what to do about those errors.

- I doesn't seem to be productive for me
